"""Signal handlers to nudge IMAP IDLE runner via Redis when accounts change.

We keep it intentionally simple: on any save/delete of AgentEmailAccount,
push the account ID onto a Redis list queue. Runners BLPOP and rescan early.

This provides low-latency reaction to new/updated accounts while the runner's
periodic scan remains the safety net.
