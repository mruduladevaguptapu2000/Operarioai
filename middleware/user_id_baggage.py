    """
    Injects the user's primary‑key into OpenTelemetry baggage so it can be
    picked up by OpenTelemetry backends.

    * If the user is authenticated, the real `user.id` is sent.
    * If the user is anonymous, an empty string (`""`) is sent.  (AnonymousUser
      has `id = None`, which serialises to the empty string by default.)

    The baggage value is pushed onto the current OTEL context *before* the view
    is executed and is removed afterwards so the value never leaks between
    requests/threads.
