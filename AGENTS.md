Running unit tests:

- Use the uv '.venv' already existing in the dir.
- Prefer to run using `uv run python manage.py test --settings=config.test_settings --parallel auto`,
  Or fall back to `python manage.py test --settings=config.test_settings`.
- Typically, run only the test(s) you need, then at the end run the full suite.
- Use `uv run` for almost everything python related

Writing unit tests:
- Ensure the test is tagged with a batch tag, e.g. `@tag('my_feature_batch')`
- Ensure the tag is registered in ci.yml

Python:
- Do NOT do annotations imports like `from __future__ import annotations`

For now, only run specific tests, not the full suite, as that will crash.

Design/UX:

- Use existing components where possible
  - Extract out common/new components as needed
- Reference preline components in vendor/
- Do not use light gray backgrounds for anything
- Do not use horizontal rules
- Keep components "integrated" --avoid container-in-container looks
- Avoid stacked shadows

Code quality:
- Pay careful attention to code organization and structure, where files go, etc. Fit the existing structure.
- Break things into multiple files, smaller testable components.
- Do things the right way.
- Leave the codebase in a better state than when you started. If you can do light refactoring, cleanup, have a net negative lines of code, that is encouraged.
- Avoid catching broad `Exception`; prefer specific exception classes so unrelated bugs are not masked.
- Prefer direct settings access (e.g., `settings.MY_SETTING`) instead of `getattr`, since defaults are centralized in `settings.py`.
- Comments should explain *why* (intent/constraints), not *what* (obvious code behavior).

Task lists:
- Only create task lists when the work genuinely benefits from tracking multiple independent pieces. For straightforward work, just do it directly without ceremony.

Debugging:
- Never guess what the issue is. Aim to *prove it* via running unit tests, adding new tests when needed (if it's something that should be covered by unit tests), running one off code with uv run django shell, etc.
