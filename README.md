Operario AI is the open-source platform for running durable autonomous agents in production.
Each agent can run continuously, wake from schedules and events, use real browsers, call external systems, and coordinate with other agents.
Each agent can also be contacted like an AI coworker: assign it an identity, email or text it, and it keeps working 24/7.

If you are optimizing for local-first personal assistant UX on a single device, there are excellent projects for that.
Operario AI is optimized for a different problem: reliable, secure, always-on agent operations for teams and businesses.

## Why Teams Choose Operario AI

- **Always-on by default**: per-agent schedule state plus durable event processing.
- **Identity-bearing agents**: each agent can have its own email address and SMS phone number, so teams can contact it directly.
- **Native agent-to-agent messaging**: linked agents can coordinate directly.
- **Webhook-native integration model**: inbound webhooks wake agents; outbound webhooks are first-class agent actions.
- **Based on browser-use**: keeps `/api/v1/tasks/browser-use/` compatibility while adding platform-level runtime controls.
- **SQLite-native operational memory**: structured state substrate for long-running tool workflows.
- **Real browser operations**: headed execution, persistent profile handling, and proxy-aware routing.
- **Security-first controls**: encrypted-at-rest secrets, proxy-governed egress, and Kubernetes sandbox compute support.

## Operario AI vs OpenClaw (Production Lens)

OpenClaw is excellent software, especially for local-first personal assistant workflows and broad channel coverage.
Operario AI is optimized for a different target: cloud-native, secure, always-on agent operations for teams.

| Dimension | Operario AI | OpenClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary deployment model | Cloud-native autonomous agent runtime (self-hosted or managed) | Local-first gateway and personal assistant runtime |
| Always-on behavior | Per-agent schedule + durable event queue continuity | Heartbeat and cron/wakeup session patterns |
| Webhook model | Inbound triggers plus outbound agent webhook actions in one lifecycle | Strong gateway ingress hooks and wake/agent webhook routes |
| Channel strategy | Fewer core channels with deeper lifecycle integration | Wider channel surface with intentionally thinner per-channel depth |
| Agent identity | Endpoint-addressable agent identities (email/SMS/web) | Workspace/session identity model |
| Human interaction model | Contact each agent directly through its own endpoint like an AI coworker | Primarily session/workspace-oriented assistant interactions |
| Agent coordination | Native agent-to-agent messaging | Orchestrator/subagent flows |
| Memory substrate | SQLite-native operational state | Markdown-first memory with optional vector acceleration |
| Browser runtime | Headed execution, persistent profiles, proxy-aware routing, distributed-worker friendly | Headed execution, persistent local profiles, strong local operator UX |
| Security defaults | Encrypted-at-rest secrets, proxy-governed egress, sandbox compute, Kubernetes/gVisor support | Local-first by design, sandboxing available but deployment-dependent |
| Best fit | Production team automation with governed runtime controls | Personal/local assistant workflows and channel breadth |

If your priority is secure, governed, always-on production execution in cloud or hybrid environments, Operario AI is purpose-built for that.

## AI Coworker Interaction Model

Operario AI agents are designed to behave like AI coworkers, not disposable one-off tasks.
You can email or text them directly, they wake from those events, execute work, and reply with context-aware follow-through.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as You / Team
    participant E as Agent Email/SMS Endpoint
    participant Q as Per-Agent Event Queue
    participant A as Always-On Operario AI Agent
    participant T as Browser/Tools/APIs

    U->>E: Send message to the agent
    E->>Q: Inbound event is queued
    Q->>A: Wake agent with full context
    A->>T: Execute tasks and gather outputs
    T-->>A: Results, files, and state updates
    A-->>U: Reply with outcome and next steps
    A->>Q: Stay active for follow-up events
```

```

### Operario AI Focus vs Typical Personal Assistant Stacks

| Area | Operario AI focus |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime model | Long-lived schedule + event lifecycle |
| Primary operator | Teams and organizations |
| Agent identity | Addressable communication endpoints |
| Orchestration | Always-on processing + native A2A |
| Browser workload shape | Production tasks with persisted state |
| Security posture | Controlled egress, encrypted secrets, sandbox compute |

## Always-On Runtime: Schedule + Event Triggers

Operario AI agents are built to stay active over time, not just respond in isolated turns.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Scheduler
    participant Q as Agent Event Queue
    participant R as Agent Runtime
    participant T as Tools
    participant C as Channels / Integrations

    S->>Q: enqueue cron trigger
    C->>Q: enqueue inbound event\n(email/sms/webhook/api)
    Q->>R: process next event for agent
    R->>T: execute required actions
    T-->>R: outputs + state updates
    R->>C: outbound reply / webhook / follow-up
    R->>Q: continue or sleep
```

This gives you continuity for real workflows: queued work, retries, deferred actions, and predictable wake/sleep behavior.

## Production Browser Runtime

Operario AI is based on browser-use and adds production runtime behavior around it.

- **Headed browser support** for realistic web workflows.
- **Persistent browser profile handling** for long-running agents.
- **Proxy-aware browser and HTTP task routing** for controlled egress paths.
- **Task-level API compatibility** via `/api/v1/tasks/browser-use/`.

## Identity, Channels, and Agent-to-Agent

Operario AI treats agents as operational entities, not just prompt sessions.
When channels are enabled, each agent can be assigned identity endpoints and contacted directly like an AI coworker.

- Agents can own communication endpoints (email, SMS, web).
- Managed deployments support first-party agent identities like `first.last@my.operario.ai`.
- Inbound email/SMS/web events can wake agents and route into the same runtime lifecycle.
- Agents can directly message linked peer agents for native coordination.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[Team member] --> E[Agent email or SMS endpoint]
    E --> A[Assigned always-on Operario AI agent]
    A <--> P[Peer Operario AI agent]
    A --> R[Reply back to human channel]
```

## Security Posture

Operario AI's architecture is built for production guardrails.

- **Encrypted secrets** integrated into agent tooling.
- **Proxy-governed outbound access** with health-aware selection and dedicated proxy inventory support.
- **Sandboxed compute support** for isolated tool execution.
- **Kubernetes backend support** with gVisor runtime-class integration in sandbox compute paths.

| Observability | `docker compose --profile obs up` | Flower + OTEL collector services |

## Production Use Cases

- **Revenue ops agents**: monitor inboxes and web systems continuously, update records, and send structured summaries.
- **Recruiting ops agents**: source candidates, enrich profiles, and coordinate outbound messaging from persistent workflows.
- **Support and success agents**: triage inbound channels, execute browser-backed actions, and escalate with full state continuity.
- **Back-office automation**: run long-lived, trigger-driven workflows that need durable memory and secure credentials handling.

## FAQ

### Is Operario AI just a UI around browser-use?

No. Operario AI is based on browser-use, but adds persistent agent runtime behavior: schedule/event lifecycle, comms channels, webhooks, memory, orchestration, and operational controls.

### Is Operario AI built for personal assistant usage?

Operario AI can power individual workflows, but the architecture is tuned for team and business operations where agents stay active and integrate into production systems.

### Does Operario AI support headed browsers?

Yes. Operario AI supports headed browser workflows and persistent profile handling for realistic web task execution.

### Can each agent be contacted directly like a coworker?

Yes. With channels configured, each agent can be assigned its own endpoint identity (email and/or SMS), so your team can interact with it directly and asynchronously.

### What does “always-on” mean here?

Agents can wake from schedules and external events (email/SMS/webhooks/API), process durable queued work, and continue across turns instead of resetting every interaction.

### What is the security model?

Operario AI integrates encrypted-at-rest secrets, proxy-aware outbound controls, and sandbox compute support with Kubernetes/gVisor backend options for stronger isolation.
